# About Daikoku

While [Otoroshi](https://maif.github.io/otoroshi/) is the perfect tool to manage your webapps in a technical point of view it lacked of business perspective. This is not the case anymore whith **Daikoku**.

While **Otoroshi** is a standalone, Daikoku is a developper portal which stands in front of **Otoroshi** and provides some business feature.

Whether you want to use **Daikoku** for your public APIs you want to monetize or with your private APIs to provide some documentation, facilitation and self-service feature, it will be the perfect portal for **Otoroshi**.

## Philosophy 

Every OSS product build at <a href="https://www.maif.fr/" target="_blank">MAIF</a> like <a href="https://maif.github.io/otoroshi/" target="_blank">Otoroshi</a> or <a href="https://maif.github.io/izanami/" target="_blank">Izanami</a> follow a common philosophy. 

* the services or API provided should be technology agnostic.
* http first: http is the right answer to the previous quote   
* api First: The UI is just another client of the api. 
* secured: The services exposed need authentication for both humans or machines  
* event based: The services should expose a way to get notified of what happened inside.
