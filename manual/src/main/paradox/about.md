## Philosophy 

Every OSS product build at <a href="https://www.maif.fr/" target="_blank">MAIF</a> like <a href="https://maif.github.io/otoroshi/" target="_blank">Otoroshi</a> or <a href="https://maif.github.io/izanami/" target="_blank">Izanami</a> follow a common philosophy. 

* the services or API provided should be technology agnostic.
* http first: http is the right answer to the previous quote   
* api First: The UI is just another client of the api. 
* secured: The services exposed need authentication for both humans or machines  
* event based: The services should expose a way to get notified of what happened inside.
