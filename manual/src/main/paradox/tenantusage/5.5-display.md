# Display modes

Two display modes are avalaible in Daikoku

## Default mode

this is the basic mode of DAikoku, business oriented. The exposed API is only linked to one service and the associated usage plans have only a commercial interest.

The API carries its documentation, its test configuration or even its swagger. The client side of Daikoku offers sections in the API page to display it.

## Environment mode

The environment mode introduces an approach focused in work environments.
It allows users to manage their consumption plans as working environments, better suited for internal corporate use. 
Find out how this feature transforms consumption plan management.
