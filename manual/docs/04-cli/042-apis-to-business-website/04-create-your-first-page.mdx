# 4 - Create your first page

# Create a new page.html file

1. In the files pane of your code editor, navigate to the folder `src/pages/` where you will see the existing file page.html
2. In that same folder, create a new file named about.html.
3. Copy, or retype the contents of page.html into your new about.html file.

:::tip
Your editor might show a solid white circle on the tab label for this file. This means that the file is not yet saved. Under the File menu in VS Code, enable “Auto Save” and you should no longer need to save any files manually.

4. Add `/about` to the end of your website preview’s URL in the address bar and check that you can see a page load there. (e.g. http://localhost:3333/about)

Right now, your `About` page should look exactly the same as the first page, but we’re going to change that!

# Edit your page

Edit the HTML content to make this page about you.

To change or add more content to your About page, add more HTML element tags containing content. You can copy and paste the HTML code below between the existing <body></body> tags, or create your own.

```html title="src/pages/about.html"
<body>
// deletion
  <h1>Welcome to my CMS</h1>
  // addition
  <h1>About Me</h1>
  // addition
  <h2>... and my new Daikoku site!</h2>
</body>
```

Now, visit your `/about` page in your browser tab again, and you should see your updated content.

# Add navigation links

To make it easier to preview all your pages, add HTML page navigation links before your 
`<h1>` at the top of both of your pages (page.html and about.html):

```html title="src/pages/about.html"
<a href="/">Home</a>
<a href="/about/">About</a>

<h1>About Me</h1>
<h2>... and my new Daikoku site!</h2>
```

Check that you can click these links to move back and forth between pages on your site.

:::note 
Unlike many frameworks, Daikoku CLI uses standard HTML `<a>` elements to navigate between pages (also called routes), with traditional page refreshes.
