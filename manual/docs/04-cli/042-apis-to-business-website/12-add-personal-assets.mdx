# 12 - Add personal assets

In this tutorial, youâ€™ve only used assets from external resources.
However, Daikoku also provides a way to upload, store, and publish your own assets to your CMS.

# Add your first asset

Download the asset used earlier in this tutorial and save it to the `src/assets/api.jpeg` location.

```sh
wget -O ./assets/api.jpeg https://images.pexels.com/photos/1148820/pexels-photo-1148820.jpeg \
    --user-agent="Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/51.0.2704.103 Safari/537.36"
```

In case of 403 failure, use one of your own assets instead.

Each asset is save in the S3 of your Daikoku (you need to configure one if it hasn't been done already by navigating to `http(s)://<daikoku-url>/settings/settings/bucket`) using the following command
```sh
daikoku assets push --filename=api.jpeg \
  --desc="Picture of API" \
  --title="API" \
  --slug=api.jpeg
```

You can now use this asset on the CMS.
