# Developer mode

In the first steps of this tutorial, we used the `watch` command to preview the project files as a website.

Run the following command:

```sh
daikoku sh
```

Then, open your browser and navigate to http://localhost:3333.  
Add the `?visualizer` query param to the end of the URL.

Note the different output when previewing pages. On the side, you'll see a list of all pages in your CMS, including mails and assets.

<div style={{textAlign: 'center', maxWidth: 600 }}>
  <img
    src={DeveloperMode}
    alt="Developer Mode sidebar"
  />
</div>
