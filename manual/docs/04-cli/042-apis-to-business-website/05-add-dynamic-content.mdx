# 5 - Add dynamic content

# Use your first directive

1. Create a new directory at `src/pages/apis/`.

Add a new (empty) file `page.html` inside your new `/apis/` folder.

Look for this page in your browser preview by adding `/apis` to the end of your existing preview URL. (e.g. http://localhost:3333/apis)

Change the browser preview URL to view /apis/test instead. (This is a page you have not yet created.)

Note the different output when previewing an `empty` page, and one that doesnâ€™t exist. This will help you troubleshoot in the future.
