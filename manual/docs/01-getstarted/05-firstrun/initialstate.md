# Import initial state

Now you are almost ready to run Daikoku for the first time, but maybe you want to import data from previous Daikoku installation into your current datastore.

To do that, you need to add the `app.init.data.from` setting to the Daikoku configuration (or `$DAIKOKU_INIT_DATA_FROM` env).

It can be a file path or a URL to the ndjson file.
