# Get Daikoku

There are several ways to get Daikoku to run it on your system.


<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="binaries" label="From binaries" default>
    If you want to download the last version of Daikoku, you can grab them from the release page of the Daikoku GitHub page:

    Go to https://github.com/MAIF/daikoku/releases and get the last version of the `daikoku-x.x.x.zip` file or the `daikoku.jar` file.
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="docker" label="From Docker">
    If you're a Docker aficionado, Daikoku is provided as a Docker image that you can pull directly from the official repos.

    Fetch the last Docker image of Daikoku :

    ```sh
    docker pull maif/daikoku:17.x.x
    # or 
    docker pull maif/daikoku:latest
    ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="sources" label="From sources">
    To build Daikoku from sources, old fashion style, you need the following tools:

    * git
    * JDK 21
    * sbt
    * node
    * npm

    Once you've installed all those tools, go to the [Daikoku GitHub page](https://github.com/MAIF/daikoku) and clone the sources:

    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/MAIF/daikoku.git --depth=1
    ```

    then you need to run the `build.sh` script to build the documentation, the React UI and the server:

    ```sh
    sh ./scripts/build.sh
    ```

    and that's all. You can grab your Daikoku package at `daikoku/target/scala-2.13/daikoku` or `daikoku/target/universal/`.

    For those who want to build only parts of Daikoku, read the following.

    ## Build the documentation only

    Go to the `manual` folder and run:

    ```sh
    npm run build
    ```

    The documentation is located at `manual/build`

    ## Build the React UI

    Go to the `daikoku/javascript` folder and run:

    ```sh
    npm install
    npm run build
    ```

    You will find the JS bundle at `daikoku/public/react-app/daikoku.js`.

    ## Build the Daikoku server

    Go to the `daikoku` folder and run:

    ```sh
    sbt ';clean;compile;dist;assembly'
    ```

    You will find your Daikoku package at `daikoku/target/scala-2.13/daikoku` or `daikoku/target/universal/`.
