# Authentication

Authentication in daikoku can be tricky. It's a tenant configuration, we are here to setup some examples.

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="local" label="Local" default>
    this is the default authentication mode. Every user can create an account in your Daikoku instance, the user profil is saved in database.
    There is no needed configuration for this mode.
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="ldap" label="LDAP">

    ## Before starting

    If you already have an up and running Daikoku instance, you can skip the following instructions and log in to your instance.

    Let’s start by [downloading the latest Daikoku](../01-getstarted/04-getdaikoku/index.mdx) and [run it](../01-getstarted/05-firstrun/run.mdx)
    
    Once Daikoku is started you can log in to your brand new instance.

    ## Running an openldap server
    
    Run  ghcr.io/rroemhild/docker-test-openldap:master docker Image

  :::note 
    _you can find all documention on the [github repo](https://github.com/rroemhild/docker-test-openldap)_
  :::


    first, pull and run your ldap. This openldap is already initialized with data based on futurama tv show.
    ```bash
    docker pull ghcr.io/rroemhild/docker-test-openldap:master
    docker run --rm -p 10389:10389 -p 10636:10636 ghcr.io/rroemhild/docker-test-openldap:master

    ```

    Let’s make the first search in our LDAP container :
    ```bash
    # List all Users
    ldapsearch -H ldap://localhost:10389 -x -b "ou=people,dc=planetexpress,dc=com" -D "cn=admin,dc=planetexpress,dc=com" -w GoodNewsEveryone "(objectClass=inetOrgPerson)"
    ```

    the response is very long due to image but at the end you shoulf have the following output:
    ```Bash
      ...
      ...
      # admin_staff, people, planetexpress.com
      dn: cn=admin_staff,ou=people,dc=planetexpress,dc=com
      objectClass: Group
      objectClass: top
      groupType: 2147483650
      cn: admin_staff
      member: cn=Hubert J. Farnsworth,ou=people,dc=planetexpress,dc=com
      member: cn=Hermes Conrad,ou=people,dc=planetexpress,dc=com

      # ship_crew, people, planetexpress.com
      dn: cn=ship_crew,ou=people,dc=planetexpress,dc=com
      objectClass: Group
      objectClass: top
      groupType: 2147483650
      cn: ship_crew
      member: cn=Philip J. Fry,ou=people,dc=planetexpress,dc=com
      member: cn=Turanga Leela,ou=people,dc=planetexpress,dc=com
      member:: Y249QmVuZGVyIEJlbmRpbmcgUm9kcsOtZ3VleixvdT1wZW9wbGUsZGM9cGxhbmV0ZXhwc
      mVzcyxkYz1jb20=

      # search result
      search: 2
      result: 0 Success

      # numResponses: 11
      # numEntries: 10
    ```

    ## Create an Authentication configuration

    - Go ahead and navigate to your Daikoku home page
    - Click on the your avatar on bottom left of the screen
    - Then `<your-tenant-name> settings` 
    - Then `Authentication` on left panel
    - You must be on `<your-domain>/settings/settings/authentication`
    - This page show the settings for the current authentication mode (by default `Local`)
    - Click on `LDAP` at the top of the form
    - Add a `LDAP Server URL` with value `ldap://localhost:10389` and `dc=planetexpress,dc=com` as `Search base`
    - Set `ou=people` as `Users search base`
    - Set `cn=ship_crew` as `Simple user filter`
    - Set `cn=admin_staff` as `Daikoku admin filter`
    - Set `(mail=${username})` as `Search filter`
    - Set `cn=admin,dc=planetexpress,dc=com` as `Admin username (bind DN)`
    - Set `GoodNewsEveryone` as `Admin password`
    - `Name fields name` can be `givenName` and `sn`
    - Set `mail` as `Email field name`

    With this configuration, all ldap users with cn `admin_staff` will be Daikoku admin otherwise, with cn `ship_crew` he will be a simple user.

    ## Testing your configuration

    Disconnect from your instance
    Then click on the Login button (or navigate to `<your-daikoku-domain>/login`)
    Set fry@planetexpress.com/fry as credentials for a simple user and professor@planetexpress.com/professor for a Daikoku admin.

    A fallback solution is always available in the event of a bad authentication configuration. 
    By going to `<your-daikoku-domain>.login`, the previous local administrators will be able to login.

  :::warning
    In one case, your search filter can be annoying. 
    if instead of mail, you've choose to log user by uid, when team admins will wants to invite a collaborator, they will be required to know the user uid.
    
    In this case you can replace `Search filter` by `(|(uid=${username})(mail=${username}))` both `uid` and `mail` will be auhtorized to log in (and search collaborator)

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="otoroshi" label="Otoroshi" default>
    ## Before starting
    If you already have an up and running Daikoku instance, you can skip the following instructions and log in to your instance.

    Let’s start by [downloading the latest Daikoku](../01-getstarted/04-getdaikoku/index.mdx) and [run it](../01-getstarted/05-firstrun/run.mdx)
    
    Once Daikoku is started you can log in to your brand new instance.

    ## Running an otoroshi server
    
    Otoroshi have his own manual to this part let's [get](https://maif.github.io/otoroshi/manual/install/get-otoroshi.html) as [run](https://maif.github.io/otoroshi/manual/install/run-otoroshi.html) your Otoroshi.

    ## Create an authentication module
    Like the previous section, you can follow instructions in [here](https://maif.github.io/otoroshi/manual/how-to-s/secure-app-with-auth0.html) to create a new Auth plugin in Otoroshi.
    You can find many possibility to secure Daikoku with Otoroshi in the documentation.

    ## Expose your daikoku by Otoroshi
  :::warning
    before exposing your daikoku instance with otoroshi, you need to setup exposing mode to Otoroshi.
  :::

    You ultimately have to add some plugins along the route to make this work :
    - Authentication, select the created Auth module in configuration to use it
    - Otoroshi info. token, you can configure the name of the header in which the authentication token will be passed and the secert to signe this token.

    ## Create an Authentication configuration

    - Go ahead and navigate to your Daikoku home page
    - Click on the your avatar on bottom left of the screen
    - Then `<your-tenant-name> settings` 
    - Then `Authentication` on left panel
    - You must be on `<your-domain>/settings/settings/authentication`
    - This page show the settings for the current authentication mode (by default `Local`)
    - Click on `Otoroshi` at the top of the form
    - Fill the header name previously setup
    - Fill the secret previously setup

    ## Testing your configuration

    Disconnect from your instance
    Then click on the Login button (or navigate to `<your-daikoku-domain>/login`)
    You can now login with a user setup with the auth module.

    :::warning
    To be daikoku admin, a user need to have a `daikokuAdmin` property in his definition setup to true. 
    You can cerate a Daikoku admin by adding a metadata in the user definition in the Auth. plugin :

    ```json
    {daikokuAdmin: true}
    ```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="oauth2" label="OAuth2" default>
  :::info
    For this tutorial, we'll use [Auth0](https://manage.auth0.com)
  :::
    ## Before starting

    If you already have an up and running Daikoku instance, you can skip the following instructions and log in to your instance.

    Let’s start by [downloading the latest Daikoku](../01-getstarted/04-getdaikoku/index.mdx) and [run it](../01-getstarted/05-firstrun/run.mdx)
    
    Once Daikoku is started you can log in to your brand new instance.

    ## Configure an Auth0 client

    The first step of this tutorial is to setup an Auth0 application with the information of the instance of our Otoroshi.

    Navigate to https://manage.auth0.com (create an account if it’s not already done).

    Let’s create an application when clicking on the Applications button on the sidebar. Then click on the Create application button on the top right.

    Choose `Regular Web Applications` as Application type
    Then set for example `daikoku-client` as Name, and confirm the creation
    Jump to the Settings tab
    Scroll to the Application URLs section and add the following urls 
      - http://localhost:9000/auth/oauth2/callback as Allowed Callback URLs 
      - http://localhost:9000 as Allowed Logout URLs
      - http://localhost:9000 as Allowed Web Origins
    Save changes at the bottom of the page.

    Once done, we have a full setup, with a client ID and secret at the top of the page, which authorizes our Daikoku and redirects the user to the callback url when they log into Auth0.

    :::warning
    To be daikoku admin, a user need to have a `daikokuAdmin` property in his definition setup to true. Daikoku get this information in the metadata of user.

    In the Auth0 case, here are the steps to follow :
    - add app metadata to a user `daikokuAdmin` with `true` as value
    - create a new custom action in auth0 :
    ```js
    exports.onExecutePostLogin = async (event, api) => {
      const { daikokuAdmin } = event.user.app_metadata;
    
      if (event.authorization) {
        api.idToken.setCustomClaim(`daikokuAdmin`, daikokuAdmin);
      }
    };
    ``` 
    - deploy it
  :::

    ## Create authentication configuration

    - Go ahead and navigate to your Daikoku home page
    - Click on the your avatar on bottom left of the screen
    - Then `<your-tenant-name> settings` 
    - Then `Authentication` on left panel
    - You must be on `<your-domain>/settings/settings/authentication`
    - This page show the settings for the current authentication mode (by default `Local`)
    - Click on `OAuth2` at the top of the form
    - Enable `Read profile from JWT token` 
    - Fill `Token scope` with `openid profile name email picture`
    - Fill `Client Id` with the client ID provided by Auth0
    - Fill `Client Secret` with the client secret provided by Auth0
    - Fill `Authorize URL` with `https://<your-auth0-tenant>.eu.auth0.com/authorize`
    - Fill `Token URL` with `https://<your-auth0-tenant>.eu.auth0.com/oauth/token`
    - Fill `Userinfo URL` with `https://<your-auth0-tenant>.eu.auth0.com/userinfo`
    - Fill `Login URL` with `https://<your-auth0-tenant>.eu.auth0.com/authorize`
    - Fill `Logout URL` with `https://<your-auth0-tenant>.eu.auth0.com/oidc/logout?redirectTo=${redirect}&client_id=${clientId}`
    - Fill `Callback URL` with `http://localhost:9000/auth/oauth2/callback`
    - Fill `Access token field name` with `access_token`
    - Fill `Name field name` with `name`
    - Fill `Email field name` with `email`
    - Fill `Picture field name` with `picture`
    
    Two optional fields can be filled :

    - `Email of Daikoku Admins` is a white list of Daikoku admins if you don't want use user metadata to setup admins
    - `jwt verifier` can be use to verify the JWT token received by Daikoku. According to the selected algorithm, the validation form will change.

      - mac + SHA
        - SHA Size: Word size for the SHA-2 hash function used
        - Hmac secret: used to verify the token
        - Base64 encoded secret: if enabled, the extracted token will be base64 decoded before it is verifier

      - RSASSA-PKCS1 + SHA
        - SHA Size: Word size for the SHA-2 hash function used
        - Public key: the RSA public key
        - Private key: the RSA private key that can be empty if not used for JWT token signing

      - JWK Set (only for verification)
        - URL: the JWK set URL where the public keys are exposed
        - HTTP call timeout: timeout for fetching the keyset
        - TTL: cache TTL for the keyset
        - HTTP Headers: the HTTP headers passed
        - Key type: type of the key searched in the jwks


      ## Testing your configuration

      Disconnect from your instance
      Then click on the Login button (or navigate to `<your-daikoku-domain>/login`)
      You can now login with a user setup with the auth module.
