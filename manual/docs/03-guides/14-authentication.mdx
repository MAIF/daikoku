# Authentication

Authentication in daikoku can be tricky. It's a tenant configuration, we are here to setup some examples.

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="ldap" label="LDAP">

    ## Before starting

    If you already have an up and running Daikoku instance, you can skip the following instructions and log in to your instance.

    Let’s start by [downloading the latest Daikoku](../01-getstarted/04-getdaikoku/index.mdx) and [run it](../01-getstarted/05-firstrun/run.mdx)
    
    Once Daikoku is started you can log in to your brand new instance.

    ## Running an openldap server
    
    Run  ghcr.io/rroemhild/docker-test-openldap:master docker Image

  :::note 
    _you can find all documention on the [github repo](https://github.com/rroemhild/docker-test-openldap)_
  :::


    first, pull and run your ldap. This openldap is already initialized with data based on futurama tv show.
    ```bash
    docker pull ghcr.io/rroemhild/docker-test-openldap:master
    docker run --rm -p 10389:10389 -p 10636:10636 ghcr.io/rroemhild/docker-test-openldap:master

    ```

    Let’s make the first search in our LDAP container :
    ```bash
    # List all Users
    ldapsearch -H ldap://localhost:10389 -x -b "ou=people,dc=planetexpress,dc=com" -D "cn=admin,dc=planetexpress,dc=com" -w GoodNewsEveryone "(objectClass=inetOrgPerson)"
    ```

    the response is very long due to image but at the end you shoulf have the following output:
    ```Bash
      ...
      ...
      # admin_staff, people, planetexpress.com
      dn: cn=admin_staff,ou=people,dc=planetexpress,dc=com
      objectClass: Group
      objectClass: top
      groupType: 2147483650
      cn: admin_staff
      member: cn=Hubert J. Farnsworth,ou=people,dc=planetexpress,dc=com
      member: cn=Hermes Conrad,ou=people,dc=planetexpress,dc=com

      # ship_crew, people, planetexpress.com
      dn: cn=ship_crew,ou=people,dc=planetexpress,dc=com
      objectClass: Group
      objectClass: top
      groupType: 2147483650
      cn: ship_crew
      member: cn=Philip J. Fry,ou=people,dc=planetexpress,dc=com
      member: cn=Turanga Leela,ou=people,dc=planetexpress,dc=com
      member:: Y249QmVuZGVyIEJlbmRpbmcgUm9kcsOtZ3VleixvdT1wZW9wbGUsZGM9cGxhbmV0ZXhwc
      mVzcyxkYz1jb20=

      # search result
      search: 2
      result: 0 Success

      # numResponses: 11
      # numEntries: 10
    ```

    ## Create an Authentication configuration

    - Go ahead and navigate to your Daikoku home page
    - Click on the your avatar on bottom left of the screen
    - Then `<your-tenant-name> settings` 
    - Then `Authentication` on left panel
    - You must be on `<your-domaain>/settings/settings/authentication`
    - This page show the settings for the current authentication mode (by default `Local`)
    - Click on `Authentication type` on the top and choose `LDAP` then click `next`
    - Add a `LDAP Server URL` with value `ldap://localhost:10389` and `dc=planetexpress,dc=com` as `Search base`
    - Set `ou=people` as `Users search base`
    - Set `cn=ship_crew` as `Simple user filter`
    - Set `cn=admin_staff` as `Daikoku admin filter`
    - Set `(mail=${username})` as `Search filter`
    - Set `cn=admin,dc=planetexpress,dc=com` as `Admin username (bind DN)`
    - Set `GoodNewsEveryone` as `Admin password`
    - `Name fields name` can be `givenName` and `sn`
    - Set `mail` as `Email field name`

    With this configuration, all ldap users with cn `admin_staff` will be Daikoku admin otherwise, with cn `ship_crew` he will be a simple user.

    ## Testing your configuration

    Disconnect from your instance
    Then click on the Login button (or navigate to `<your-daikoku-domain>/login`)
    Set fry@planetexpress.com/fry as credentials for a simple user and professor@planetexpress.com/professor for a Daikoku admin.

    A fallback solution is always available in the event of a bad authentication configuration. 
    By going to `<your-daikoku-domain>.login`, the previous local administrators will be able to login.

  :::warning
    In one case, your search filter can be annoying. 
    if instead of mail, you've choose to log user by uid, when team admins will wants to invite a collaborator, they will be required to know the user uid.
    
    In this case you can replace `Search filter` by `(|(uid=${username})(mail=${username}))` both `uid` and `mail` will be auhtorized to log in (and search collaborator)

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="local" label="Local" default>
    this is the default authentication mode. Every user can create an account in your Daikoku instance, the user profil is saved in database.
    There is no needed configuration for this mode.
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="otoroshi" label="Otoroshi" default>
  :::info  
    To get otoroshi as Authentication mode, Daikoku need to be exposed by Otoroshi 

    Daikoku will be accessible with url proxified by Otoroshi and base url of Daikoku. You betterto follow this tutorial to expose Daikoku with Otoroshi
  :::
    ## Before starting
    If you already have an up and running Daikoku instance, you can skip the following instructions and log in to your instance.

    Let’s start by [downloading the latest Daikoku](../01-getstarted/04-getdaikoku/index.mdx) and [run it](../01-getstarted/05-firstrun/run.mdx)
    
    Once Daikoku is started you can log in to your brand new instance.

    ## Running an otoroshi server
    
    Otoroshi have his own manual to this part let's [get](https://maif.github.io/otoroshi/manual/install/get-otoroshi.html) as [run](https://maif.github.io/otoroshi/manual/install/run-otoroshi.html) your Otoroshi.

    ## Create an authentication module
    Like the previous section, you can follow instructions in [here](https://maif.github.io/otoroshi/manual/how-to-s/secure-app-with-auth0.html) to create a new Auth plugin in Otoroshi.
    You can find many possibility to secure Daikoku with Otoroshi in the documentation.

    ## Expose your daikoku by Otoroshi
  :::warning
    before exposing your daikoku instance with otoroshi, you need to setup exposing mode to Otoroshi. read this following [tutorial](./15-otoroshi-exposition) before continue.
  :::

    You ultimately have to add some plugins along the route to make this work :
    - Authentication, select the created Auth module in configuration to use it
    - Otorshi info. token, you can configure the name of the header in which the authentication token will be passed and the secert to signe this token.

    ## Create an Authentication configuration

    - Go ahead and navigate to your Daikoku home page
    - Click on the your avatar on bottom left of the screen
    - Then `<your-tenant-name> settings` 
    - Then `Authentication` on left panel
    - You must be on `<your-domaain>/settings/settings/authentication`
    - This page show the settings for the current authentication mode (by default `Local`)
    - Click on `Authentication type` on the top and choose `Otoroshi` then click `next`
    - Fill the header name previously setup
    - Fill the secret previously setup

    ## Testing your configuration

    Disconnect from your instance
    Then click on the Login button (or navigate to `<your-daikoku-domain>/login`)
    You can now login with a user setup with the auth module.

  :::warning
    To be daikoku admin, a user need to have a `daikokuAdmin` property in his definition setup to true. You can get it with Otoroshi be filling the right `Otoroshi metadata field name`.

    In the Auth0 case, Here are the steps to follow :
    - add app metadata to to a user ({"daikokuAdmin": true})
    - create a new custom action in auth0 :
    ```js
    exports.onExecutePostLogin = async (event, api) => {
      const { daikokuAdmin } = event.user.app_metadata;
    
      if (event.authorization) {
        api.idToken.setCustomClaim(`daikokuAdmin`, daikokuAdmin);
      }
    };
    ``` 
    - retrieve the value by setup `Otoroshi metadata field name` in your auth module with `daikokuAdmin`

    with this method, otoroshi will add the daikokuAdmin value to the claim
