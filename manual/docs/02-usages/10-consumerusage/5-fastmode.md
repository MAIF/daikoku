# Fast mode

The fast mode page allows for API key requests to be made more quickly.

First, it is necessary to select a team for which a request is desired, then the process can be facilitated by using a filtering system. Only the APIs that are visible to the team are displayed.

Finally, additional information about a plan can be displayed by clicking above, and the API keys can be viewed by clicking the "view API keys" button.
