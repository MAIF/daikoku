# Subscribe to an API

## Choose a plan
First of all, you need to choose an API to subscribe. In the information page of the API, select the `Plans` tab.
Here are presented the different pricing plans of the API (if team decides to present multiple plans).
Just click the `subscribe` button. If you are member of several teams, please choose teams to make subscription and click the `subscribe` button.

If the plan has no process of subscription, a green message appears to inform you that the subscription is successful.
Otherwise, the process is followed step by step until the subscription is generated (it could take a few moment).

### Payment Process

When a user reaches the payment step in the subscription process, Daikoku facilitates the transition to the payment gateway to collect payment information and process the transaction. Here's how it works:

  1.** Redirect to the checkout page**: The user is automatically redirected to a secure payment page, where they can enter their payment information, such as credit card details.

  2. **Payment Information Handling**: Daikoku does not store user payment information. All payment details are collected directly by the payment gateway, ensuring the security of sensitive data.

  3. **Transaction Processing**: The payment gateway processes the transaction using the payment information provided by the user. Once the transaction is successfully validated, Daikoku receives a payment confirmation notification.

  4. **Subscription Validation**: After payment validation, Daikoku marks the subscription as approved in the system. The user is then redirected to the Daikoku homepage, where they can start using the subscribed API features.

> If a user has already subscribed via the payment gateway, his team and information will be retrieved because they are associated with their Daikoku IDs.

## Fast mode
Daikoku offers a fast mode to display, for a selected team, only accessible APIs (and subscriptions plans with their informations). In this UI, you can subscribe to all plan without switching pages and get subscription credentials.
