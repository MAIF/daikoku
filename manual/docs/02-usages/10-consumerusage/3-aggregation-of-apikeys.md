# Use an API key on multiple apis

By default, the API keys, generated from Daikoku, can't be used on multiple plans.
If this feature is enabled for the tenant and the API, the `request api key` button will prompt a choice : subscribe with a new API key or subscribe using an existing API key.

When the rights of an API key is extended, you can visualize the link between the root API key and the children "extended" API keys, directly in the API keys view.
