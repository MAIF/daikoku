# Managing sessions

With Daikoku, you can manage connected users' sessions and you can discard sessions whenever you want. Sessions last 24 hours by default and you can customize them with tenant authentication information [tenant config.](./1-tenants.md)

## Admin. sessions

To see the last current admin session on Daikoku from the UI, go to `settings (avatar icon) / Organizations settings` and then `User sessions`. You can discard individual sessions or all sessions at once using `Delete` button (trash icon) or `Delete all sessions` button.
