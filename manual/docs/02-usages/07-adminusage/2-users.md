# Managing users

Users in Daikoku can be available in all tenants. As Daikoku admin, you are responsible for managing users.

## Admin status

Nothing's easier than to give or remove admin status to **another** user. Just hover over the user's avatar and click on the `toggle admin status` button (shield icon).
It's impossible to remove oneself the admin status.

## Create a new user

To create a new user, just click on the `Create new user` button. 
You will have some informations to fill :

* User's name
* User's email address
* Possibly user's avatar. It could be an URL or an assets from the object manager
* Activate / deactivate the admin status
* User's password
* User's personal token (useful for integration APIs)
* The tenants that are accessible to the user
* Metadata

To finalize the creation, click on the `Create` button.

## Remove User

To delete a user, just hover over the avatar and click on `Delete` button (bin icon). Finally, confirm the command.

## Impersonate user

Daikoku provides users impersonation. Just hover over the avatar and click on the `impersonate` button (ninja icon).
