# Managing API groups

## What is an API group?

An API group is a meta-API that allows you to group multiple APIs together based on their usage. While it was initially designed to group related use cases, in practice, it serves primarily as a visual wrapper that provides a unified entry point for multiple related APIs.

An API group is built similarly to a regular API—it displays a description, documentation, and an OpenAPI definition. However, it also allows users to dive deeper and access the individual APIs within the group separately.

## Key characteristics

### Visual grouping
API groups provide a cohesive presentation layer for multiple APIs, making it easier for consumers to discover and understand related services.

### Independent subscriptions
Subscriptions to an API group are completely decoupled from the underlying APIs. Each has its own plans and Otoroshi targets, meaning:
- Subscribing to the group doesn't automatically grant access to individual APIs
- Each API maintains its own subscription flow and authorization rules
- Plans and billing are managed independently

### Producer permissions
Only API producers can add their APIs to a group. This ensures that teams maintain control over how their APIs are presented and grouped.

## Create a new API group

To create a new API group, click on the `+ Create an API` button displayed on dashbaord and then `create as APIgroups`.

### Basic information
An API group is basically an APi, it need same informations to be created.

### Grouping APIs
The main difference from a regular API is the ability to reference multiple APIs within the group:

1. Navigate to the **APIs** section in the API group configuration
2. Select the APIs you want to include in this group

:::note
You can only add APIs that your team owns.

### Individual API access
When consumers view an API group, they can:
- See the group's overview and documentation
- Browse the list of APIs included in the group
- Access each individual API's detailed page
- Subscribe to the group or to individual APIs separately (if it's possible)

## Subscription management

API group subscriptions work independently from individual API subscriptions:

- **Group plans**: Define quotas, pricing, and validation steps for the group as a whole
- **API plans**: Each API maintains its own plans and subscription process
- **No inheritance**: Subscribing to a group doesn't automatically provide access to its APIs

## Use cases

API groups are particularly useful for:

- **Domain-based grouping**: Group all APIs related to a specific business domain (e.g., "Payment APIs", "User Management APIs")
- **Product bundles**: Create logical product offerings that span multiple technical APIs
- **Versioning strategies**: Group different versions of related APIs
- **Documentation organization**: Provide a single entry point for complex, multi-service architectures

## Best practices

- **Clear naming**: Use descriptive names that immediately convey the group's purpose
- **Coherent grouping**: Only group APIs that are logically related
- **Comprehensive documentation**: Explain how the APIs in the group work together
- **Independent but aligned**: While subscriptions are independent, consider aligning plans and pricing for consistency
- **Regular updates**: Keep the group's API list up to date as your architecture evolves
